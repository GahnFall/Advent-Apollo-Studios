Pro:
Pro commands are basic commands with accurate timing.
These lead to skill combos and counters. If a basic skill is used within .5 second of  a trigger skill, either a counter, reversal or a combo will take place. Reversals will stack until one side lands a hit and gains a 200% damage multiplier per stack on each player/npc. 
Boosting an attack ability drops your defense for 3 seconds and vice versa

Counter 200% damage multiplier Attack < Block
Riposte  200% damage multiplier and removes opponent's wepaon Attack/Block < Parry
Upperhand 150% damage multiplier and increases evasion for 3 seconds Attack < Dodge
Reversal 400% damage multiplier + 200% per reversal stack
Tangle both parties lose 10% of current health when using the same basic skill within .3seconds of one another, excluding Attack. 
Parry < Parry/Dodge < Dodge/Block < Block/Parry < Dodge
