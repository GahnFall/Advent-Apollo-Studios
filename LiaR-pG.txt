In the event of a time freeze, all townsfolk must gather at the town center to resolve the issue swiftly.(excluding on-duty guards) If the town center is damaged or cannot be reached. Search out the nearest townsmember, and, as a group, search for the others. Do this until all the townsfolk are accounted for. The town will be sealed off automatically. All entrances and exits will be blocked/guarded to control the flow of movement.
A giant clock displaying the time, located in the town center for all to see, will be the only clock in the town. This is to keep everyone on the same page.
